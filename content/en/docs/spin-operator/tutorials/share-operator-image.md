You can build and push the Spin Operator image using the `docker-build` and `docker-push` targets specified in the `Makefile`.

 * The `docker-build` task invokes local `docker` tooling and builds a Docker image matching your local system architecture. 
 * The `docker-push` task invokes local `docker` tooling and pushes the Docker image to a container registry.

You can chain both targets using `make docker-build docker-push` to perform build and push at once. 

Ensure to provide the fully qualified image name as `IMG` argument to push your custom Spin Operator image to the desired container registry:

```shell
# Build & Push the Spin Operator Image
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/spin-operator:tag
```

> This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above command doesn't work.

## Build and Push multi-arch Images

There are scenarios where you may want to build and push the Spin Operator image for multiple architectures. This is done by using the underlying [Buildx](https://docs.docker.com/build/architecture/) capabilitites provided by Docker.

You use the `docker-build-and-publish-all` target specified in the `Makefile` to build and push the Spin Operator image for multiple architectures at once:

```shell
# Build & Push the Spin Operator Image for arm64 and amd64
make docker-build-and-publish-all
```

Optionally, you can specify desired architectures by providing the `PLATFORMS` argument as shown here:

```shell
# Build & Push the Spin Operator Image form desired architectures explicitly
make docker-build-and-publish-all PLATFORMS=linux/arm64,linux/amd64
```
