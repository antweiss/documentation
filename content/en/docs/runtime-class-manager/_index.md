The [Runtime Class Manager, also known as the Containerd Shim Lifecycle Operator](https://github.com/spinkube/runtime-class-manager), is designed to automate and manage the lifecycle of containerd shims in a Kubernetes environment. This includes tasks like installation, update, removal, and configuration of shims, reducing manual errors and improving reliability in managing WebAssembly (Wasm) workloads and other containerd extensions.

The Runtime Class Manager provides a robust and production-ready solution for installing, updating, and removing shims, as well as managing node labels and runtime classes in a Kubernetes environment. 

By automating these processes, the runtime-class-manager enhances reliability, reduces human error, and simplifies the deployment and management of containerd shims in Kubernetes clusters.
